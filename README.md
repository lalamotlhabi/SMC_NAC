#VIP - Variant Interpretation tool Portal  - Data Curation and Upload to mongoDB 
##VIP is a Systems Biology Platform for Cell Line centric Intergrative Analysis of Molecular and Functional Genomic Data (Julio Fernandez et al.)

In this repository we seek to document ("Rmarkdowns"), track,  curation and upload progress of  all the  various projects data set for VIP     

Ideally, we would like for all compiled Rmarkdown to serve as templates/guides  with additional room for further suggestions and/or feedback.

For each  project Data curation there will be a corresponding a created github-project, with enabled "issues" tracker
